# Medical Price Dataset Analysis using Linear Regression

This repository contains an analysis of a medical price dataset using linear regression supervised learning. The goal of this project is to predict medical prices based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Medical Price Dataset, which contains information about medical procedures and their corresponding prices. The dataset includes the following features:

- Age: The age of the patient.
- Sex: The gender of the patient.
- BMI: Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- Children: how many kids does the person have
- Smoker: Whether the patient is a smoker or a non-smoker.
- Region: The region where the patient is located.
- Charges: The price of the medical procedure.

The dataset is provided in a CSV format and can be found in this repository.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using linear regression, a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict medical prices based on the given charges and age.

The analysis is implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

The analysis code can be found in the `medical_price_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file with its results.
